each player receives 5 numbers (between 1 and 10), and they need to use each number once to create a valid mathematical equation using +, -, *, /, and =. The first player to solve it correctly gets a point.

Here’s how we can approach building this game:

Define the Game Rules:
Each player receives 5 random numbers between 1 and 10.
Players must use all 5 numbers exactly once.
They can use the following operators: +, -, *, /, and =.
The goal is to create a valid equation that evaluates to a true statement.
The first player to solve it correctly wins a point.
Generate Random Numbers:
We’ll need a way to generate 5 random numbers between 1 and 10 for each player. We can use the Random class in C#.
User Input:
We’ll prompt each player to input their 5 numbers.
We’ll validate the input to ensure it meets the game rules (unique numbers, within the specified range).
Equation Validation:
After receiving the input, we’ll construct an equation using the provided numbers and operators.
We’ll evaluate the equation and check if it’s true.
If true, the player gets a point; otherwise, we’ll prompt them to try again.
Repeat for Multiple Rounds:
We can repeat the game for multiple rounds or until players decide to stop.
Display Scores:
Keep track of each player’s score and display it after each round.
